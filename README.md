</pre>

In this simple Phaser®-Built arcade-style game, you're that green fella dodging falling red fellas from the sky!<br>
As the game progresses, the red fellas get bigger and faster 0_0!<br>

How long can you skimble?

### Known issues: 
- ~~Loading the game could take about 2-4 seconds, i'm working on optimizing that~~
- ~~the game's resolution is a bit.. cranky.~~
- ~~the "𝚜𝚔𝚒𝚖𝚋𝚕𝚎" font sometimes doesn't render on first launch, i'm investigating that too.~~
- the "𝚜𝚔𝚒𝚖𝚋𝚕𝚎" font does not render on Chromium-based browsers for some reason, I'm investigating that issue.
- the game is NOT optimized for mobile devices, and that's not currently planned either.
- i have <b>not</b> set any conditions regarding the game's difficulty decay onwards, meaning it <i>will</i> get exponentially harder as you progress, addressing that is on my to-do, but for right now: (your skill issue is not my problem!)
